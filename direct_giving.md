## Commitment to Direct Giving

***Put some text here about how it's important to get commitment forms, even if they are $0, so we know what to expect and when.***

[Direct Giving Commitment 2023-2024](https://form.jotform.com/232260694125150)

## Paying your Direct Giving

Your Direct Giving can be paid online via:

- [Arts People (one-time or recurring payments)](https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?contribution=odyk8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=LAGJCDXWJ2W7W){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

You can also pay by check. Make your check payable to "Odyssey PTA" and put your student or students' name(s) in the memo line. Drop your check in the PTA box in the front office, or mail to:

> ODYSSEY PTA<br>
> 1849 SW 58TH AVE<br>
> PORTLAND OR 97221

## Confidentiality

Your Direct Giving commitment is seen only by the Direct Giving Coordinator. We limit access to Direct Giving payment information as much as possible:

- Arts People payments are managed directly by the Direct Giving Coordinator. Arts People transfers a lump sum to the PTA's bank account monthly.
- PayPal payments and checks are handled by the Treasurer, who reports the individual payments to the Direct Giving Coordinator.
- PayPal and check transactions are visible to the other bank account signers, i.e., the President and Secretary.
