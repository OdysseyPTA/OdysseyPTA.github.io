      <description>The Odyssey Auditorium The Odyssey auditorium has limited space. While we would love to accommodate everyone who wants to see every performance, that isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. We offer two showings of every performance.1 Offering two showings balances the desire to accommodate as many people as possible with the reality that the students, teachers, and volunteers involved in the performances have limited time and energy. When planning your attendance, please abide by the limits we set.</description>
