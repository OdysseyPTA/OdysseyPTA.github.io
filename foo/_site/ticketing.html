    <h1 id="the-odyssey-auditorium">The Odyssey Auditorium</h1>

<p>The Odyssey auditorium has limited space. While we would love to accommodate everyone who wants to see every performance, that isn’t possible. We offer two showings of every performance.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Offering two showings balances the desire to accommodate as many people as possible with the reality that the students, teachers, and volunteers involved in the performances have limited time and energy. When planning your attendance, please abide by the limits we set. The limits are intended to ensure that every Odyssey family has equal access to this important part of the Odyssey experience.</p>

<p>We utilize online ticketing to make the process as efficient and equitable as possible. Links to the ticketing form will be sent out a week or two before the first day of the performance.</p>

<p>The auditorium is not air conditioned. There is heat, but it will be off because it is both noisy and unnecessary. During performances a ramp is installed in the southwest entrance to the auditorium.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the ticketing process specifically, please contact the ticketing team for the performance. That information will be available from the online ticketing form.</p>

<h1 id="k12-and-345-performances">K12 and 345 Performances</h1>

<p>Attendance at the K12 and 345 performances is limited to the families of students within the performing cluster. Seating is general admission. Given typical cluster enrollment, offering two performances allows for four seats per student each year. <strong>The seat limit is <em>not</em> per showing.</strong> The seat limit is across the pair of showings. Split it up as needed. Before deciding to split your attendance, please keep in mind that parking is also very limited. When it is time to allocate seating, the cluster teachers or coordinator will send everyone a link to the ticketing form. Tickets are free. They are used solely to manage auditorium capacity.</p>

<p>The form will ask for the name of the student who is associated with the ticket or tickets being ordered. Please use the first and last name of the student. We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">audit</a> the ticket reservations. It’s easier to get a count if the student’s name is clear.</p>

<p>If someone is not using their entire allocation of tickets, spare tickets can be given to the families of other students. The smoothest way to manage that is to have the receiving individual reserve the ticket and use the name of the student who is giving up the seat.</p>

<p>We do our best to ensure that everyone who wants tickets claims their tickets. Then, if there is still space available, we will notify the cluster that each student may have one additional ticket, first-come first-serve, up to the capacity of each showing.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<h3 id="i-dont-care-which-showing-i-go-to-what-can-i-do-to-help-everyone-else">I don’t care which showing I go to. What can I do to help everyone else?</h3>

<p>Usually the first showing has more demand than the second showing. Choose the second showing.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="the-limit-is-four-tickets-i-need-five-tickets-what-can-i-do">The limit is four tickets. I need five tickets. What can I do?</h3>

<p>You have two options to get that extra ticket:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Wait until you are released to obtain a fifth ticket within a couple days of the performance. This is a last-minute option that requires flexibility and quick action. The original capacity stays the same, so make sure you get your fifth ticket before everyone else fills up the performance. Option 2 may be more reliable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communicate with your peers in the Odyssey community. Find someone who isn’t using their full allocation and is willing to share with you.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-do-i-get-more-than-one-extra-ticket">How do I get more than one extra ticket?</h3>

<p>Communicate with your peers in the Odyssey community. Find someone who isn’t using their full allocation and is willing to share with you. Repeat as necessary.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-communicate-with-my-peers-in-the-odyssey-community">How do I communicate with my peers in the Odyssey community?</h3>

<p>Respectfully and patiently. Go somewhere that Odyssey community members hang out (e.g., afterschool pick-up, Coffee Cart, etc.) and find someone to talk to.</p>

<p>Within the context of ticketing, we’re experimenting with a Google Group to supplement other means. A link should have been included with the ticket announcement and should be on the ticketing form.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> If you use Facebook, you can check the Odyssey Facebook group.</p>

      <p>“But won’t this load up the second showing instead?” If we find this to be a problem, we will update the FAQ. We’re skeptical that enough people both, (1) genuinely don’t care which date/time they attend, and (2) will read this far in this document, to skew attendance heavily to the second showing. Feel free to flip a coin instead. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
